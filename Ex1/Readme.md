Challenge Title: "RESTful API for Task Management"

Challenge Description:
Build a RESTful API for managing tasks. This challenge is designed to help you improve your backend engineering skills and gain experience in creating API endpoints, handling data, and implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Requirements:

1. **API Endpoints**: Create API endpoints for performing CRUD operations on tasks. Your API should have endpoints for:
   - Creating a new task.
   - Retrieving a list of all tasks.
   - Retrieving a single task by ID.
   - Updating a task by ID.
   - Deleting a task by ID.

2. **Data Structure**: Define the data structure for a task, which should include at least the following fields:
   - Task ID (unique identifier).
   - Task title.
   - Task description.
   - Task due date.
   - Task status (e.g., "open," "in progress," "completed").

3. **Database**: Implement data storage for tasks. You can use a relational database like SQLite or PostgreSQL or a NoSQL database like MongoDB. Set up the necessary tables or collections to store task data.

4. **Validation**: Implement input validation to ensure that only valid data is accepted for creating and updating tasks. Handle validation errors gracefully and return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.

5. **Authentication and Authorization**: Add basic authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure your API. Create user accounts with roles (e.g., admin, regular user), and ensure that only authorized users can create, update, or delete tasks.

6. **Documentation**: Create clear and concise API documentation that explains how to use each endpoint, including request formats and expected responses. You can use tools like Swagger or Postman for documentation.

7. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to provide meaningful error responses in case of issues, such as invalid requests or server errors.

8. **Testing**: Write unit tests and/or integration tests to ensure the correctness of your API. You can use testing frameworks like JUnit, Mocha, or pytest.

9. **Deployment**: Deploy your API to a hosting service of your choice (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean). Provide clear deployment instructions.

10. **Security**: Implement security best practices, such as input validation, protection against SQL injection (if using a relational database), and securing sensitive data like passwords.

Bonus Challenges:
1. Implement user registration and authentication using OAuth or JWT tokens.

2. Add features like task prioritization, categories, or labels.

3. Implement pagination and filtering for task retrieval endpoints to handle large datasets efficiently.

4. Set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) for your project.

5. Implement rate limiting and throttling to protect your API from abuse.

By completing this backend engineering challenge, you'll gain valuable experience in designing and building RESTful APIs, working with databases, securing your application, and creating comprehensive documentation. This project can be adapted to various programming languages and frameworks, making it a versatile learning opportunity.
