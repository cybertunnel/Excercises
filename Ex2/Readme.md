Challenge Title: "Simple Calculator"

Challenge Description:
Create a C++ program that simulates a simple calculator. This challenge will help you practice basic input/output operations, conditional statements, and arithmetic operations in C++.

Requirements:

1. **Menu System**: Implement a menu-driven system that allows the user to choose from the following operations:
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division
   - Exit the program

2. **Input**: Prompt the user to enter two numbers and select an operation from the menu.

3. **Calculations**: Perform the selected operation on the two numbers and display the result. Ensure proper handling of division by zero.

4. **User Interaction**: Provide clear instructions and error handling. Handle invalid inputs gracefully, such as non-numeric input or an invalid menu choice.

5. **Repeat Operation**: Allow the user to perform multiple calculations in a loop until they choose to exit.

6. **Code Organization**: Organize your code into functions to keep it modular and easy to read. Follow best practices for C++ coding style and use comments to explain your code.

7. **User-Friendly Output**: Make the program's output clear and user-friendly, providing informative messages and formatting for readability.

8. **Error Handling**: Ensure that the program doesn't crash due to unexpected inputs or operations. Use conditional statements to handle errors and edge cases.

Sample Output:
```
Simple Calculator

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Exit

Enter your choice (1-5): 1
Enter the first number: 12
Enter the second number: 8
Result: 12 + 8 = 20

Enter your choice (1-5): 4
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 0
Error: Division by zero is not allowed.

Enter your choice (1-5): 5
Goodbye!
```

Bonus Challenges:
1. Implement additional mathematical functions like exponentiation or square root.

2. Allow the user to perform continuous calculations without exiting the program after each operation.

3. Add support for handling floating-point numbers.

4. Create a more advanced calculator with memory functionality (e.g., store and recall previous results).

5. Implement error handling for invalid menu choices.
